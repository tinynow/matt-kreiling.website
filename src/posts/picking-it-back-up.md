I was so proud of myself for the first month of developing in the open. I spun up a website and wrote five blog posts, learned a whole bunch and shipped despite doing deep dives.

A month and a half later. I am picking up the work again.

## What happened to my velocity
In some software development practices, velocity is the amount of work you get done.

Life's velocity did not slow, but I can't really blame all the happenings in my life for not working towards one of my handful of large goals. 

Building up this website, filling it up with content is critical to flexibility in my career because I do not have enough evidence of my expertise and abilities. My job is behind the walls of a government agency, hidden within codebases I cannot share and non-coding activities that I need to write about (before I forget). It's Important Work.

Instead, I prototyped a word game called Annoying Bee. 
<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-slug-hash="dymyZeb" data-user="tinynow" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

I am tempted to list all the stuff other than this website that I did these last 45 days, but there is always time if you make it. There have been fungible hours of desultory wandering around my house and garden, podcast bingeing, youtube rabbit holes, and other entertainments. Those hours when I had adequate energy and focus could have been exchanged for hours doing the Important Work.

It may be that I the joy of making a game, or some myriad excuses caused the issue, but an easier and probably more useful explanation is Resistance. This is a metaphor that author [Steven Pressfield](https://stevenpressfield.com/home/) explains in his book _The War of Art_. Instead of diving deep into the causes of procrastination, he names the culprit Resistance. If you have ever procrastinated or suffered from writer's block, the feeling that you feel right before you give up or that prevents you from getting started is Resistance. Don't complicate it. Call it Resistance and know that it's the enemy.

Resistance killed my velocity.

It looked like failure. I was not able to design my header or even pick colors that looked good together. I was a failure as a visual designer. I started to experiment over and over with new CSS techniques, animations, copying techniques for isometric designs, tweaking color schemes.  Like addiction, Resistance is cunning and insidious. It looks like a lot of things. But you defeat it the same way every time &mdash; by doing the Important Work.

Some tactics in this war are:
1. Stop being a perfectionist.
2. Be a professional.
3. Do the work for its own sake.

As far as perfectionism goes, I am combating my own tendency with some deliberate [imperfectionism]({{ '/posts/perfectionism' | url }}) to the best of my ability.

What Pressfield means by being a professional is that you must consider the important work your job not a part of your identity or a joyous activity that compels you.

    <blockquote>
    Grandiose fantasies are a symptom of Resistance. 
    They're the sign of an amateur. The professional has learned that success, like happiness, comes as a by-product of work.

But most professionals do the work to get paid, and while that is sometimes a side effect of creative work, sometimes the work itself is the end. Resistance points us towards the Important Work because that which is most worth doing is that which we fear the most.

This idea, the idea of fearing that which is good for us, is an idea for another time.
