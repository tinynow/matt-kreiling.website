I am developing this site in the open. Hopefully this will counterbalance my tendency towards perfectionism.

I am using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to build this site, working off of the [official base blog starter](https://eleventy-base-blog.netlify.app/).

I aspire to post one of these <a href="{{ '/tags/developing-in-the-open/' | url }}">developing in the open</a> posts frequently, as part of my workflow. Maybe as some sort of release notes.

## Release notes

- Initialized Eleventy blog.
- Edited metadata.json
- Reviewed code in `eleventy.js` file
    - TIL the [url filter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/url/) for normalizing urls, not sure if I need this...
- Even the simplest technology can still seem more complex than it needs to be, until you need the complexity.
